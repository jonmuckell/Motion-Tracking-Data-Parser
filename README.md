# Motion-Tracking-Data-Parser
Extracts key metrics from motion tracking data (in MVNX / XML format).  Extract data can be used to determine if lifting and transfer movements risk injury.  Software is based on research paper presented at ACM Digital Health Conference (DigH) 2017.

## Source Code
Builds under Python v2.7

## Input Data
By default data is input in the same source directory as source code. Four sample data files are provided.  However, by default, the code runs a single file (0_Bed_to_ShowerChair_M.mvnx).  You can add the others .mvnx files (or your own data) by uncommenting/editing main.py.   If you input MVNX or XML file follows different formatting rules, you will need to edit MotionCaptureExecutor.py and edit the parsing rules.

## Results
By default results are placed in the results.csv
